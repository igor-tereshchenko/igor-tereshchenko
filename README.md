### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Igor Tereshchenko. I help people to achieve their goals with my skills in software engineering. During my career I had a chance to work closely with so many smart, kind and experienced people, so learning from them made a very big impact on my growth as an engineer in a wide range of roles. I'm currently working as an Engineering Lead and a Team Lead at https://www.lovecrafts.com in London, UK.
